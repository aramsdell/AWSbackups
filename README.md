# AWSbackups
Oldie but goodie script I used to back up AWS EC2s, got it from http://www.messor.com/aws-disaster-recovery-automation-w-powershell/
Since then, the SDK was deprecated and the scripts have been updated here: https://github.com/noahlh/aws-automated-backup-powershell

#SQL Server backup
There is also a SQL Server backup script in this repo written by Michael Friis (http://friism.com) and still available on his blog through the Search. I am not sure I got this one to work and the SDK is out of date. I ended up going another route - getting as real SQL Server DBA to do the backups for me
